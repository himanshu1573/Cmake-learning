# Hello, CMake!

This project demonstrates how to set up and build a simple "Hello, World!" application using **CMake**. Additionally, this README explores insights from the **Git Pull Request (PR) process** and the concept of **buffer overflows** in C++ programming.

## Project Overview

This project uses **CMake** to manage the build system, generating an executable that prints a greeting message to the console. It's an excellent starting point for understanding CMake's role in C++ development and applying version control best practices with Git.

## CMake Overview

**CMake** is a build system generator that helps manage compilation in multi-platform C++ projects. CMake creates system-specific build files (like Makefiles on Unix and Visual Studio solutions on Windows), enabling consistent builds across environments.

## Project Setup and Build Steps

To compile and run this project, follow these steps:

### Install CMake (if not installed)

- **macOS**: `brew install cmake`
- **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install cmake`

### Clone the repository (or place project files in a directory).

### Create a `build` directory within the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

cmake ..
cmake --build .
./HelloCMake
